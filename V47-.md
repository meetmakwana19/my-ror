### V47 - CRUD

1. Create
   1. `new` - Display new record form. /subjects/new
   2. `create` - Process new record form. /subjects/create
2. Read 
   1. `index` - List records. /subjects/create
   2. `show` - Display a single record. /subjects/show/:id
3. Update
   1. `edit` - Display edit record form. /subjects/edit/:id
   2. `update` - Process edit record form. /subjects/update/:id
4. Delete
   1. `delete` -Display delete record form. /subjects/delete/:id
   2. `destroy` - Process delete record form. /subjects/destroy/:id

- Dividing the controller by Separate controllers 
  - SubjectsController, PagesController,  SectionsController.
  - One controller per model
  - Use plural names

1. Generating a new model with action views in the command itself.
```
rails generate controller Subjects index show new edit delete
```
2. Adding another extra CRUD action methods in the subjects_controller.rb

### V48 - REST (Representational State Transfer)

1. Do not perform procedures 
2. Perform state trasformations upon resources.

REST Paradigm Requirements

1. Organize code into resources

   Encourages one controller for each model

2. Learn HTTP verbs(GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) for working with resources

   Determine which CRUD actions are suited for each verb

3. Map a new URL syntax to controller actions

   Change Rails routes

4. Modify existing links and forms to use new URL syntax.    

   Use resourceful URL helpers

- Different HTML versions have varying number of support for REST. So rails have a work around for it to work REST universally.
  - It fakes a true REST request by adding a hidden field called `_method` to the form and uses POST for that form.

### V49 - Resourcefull routes 

1. URL accessed by rails is different in REST which are called as resourceful routes used to access the basic CRUD actions in our controller.
2. Rails default
3. Optimized for rais 
4. Simple, consistent and organized structure
5. Improves application security.
6. Most proffessional developers use them.
7. Saves alot of typing
8. Shortcut to create a resourceful route in rails 
```
resources :subjects
```
8. Rails doesnt include all 8 of the REST actions. DELETE is not by default included ny rails. As it's optional to view the info before deleting it like a confirmation pop up.
9. Can limit the resources to be accessed by the routes by adding `:except =>` or `:only =>` to the definition.
10. Can add additional resourceful routes by adding `member` and `collection` to the definition. 
    1.  `member` routes operate on a member of the resource. They expect to recieve a record id in the URL. eg. EDIT & UPDATE Are buil-in member routes.
    2.  `collection` routes operate as a whole. They do not expect a record ID In the URL. eg. INDEX, NEW, CREATE
11. It is common to operate both on resourceful and simple routes. Like a simple route to just show an about page of static HTML not requiring any resources.
12. Added resourceful route for subjects on the routes.rb
13. Command to see all the routes of our rails app.
```
rails routes
```

### V50 - Resourceful URL helpers 

1. Instead of writing a hash for route like `{:controller => 'subjects', :action => "show", id => 3}` we can write `subject_path(3)`.
2. Almost all of the URL helpers use subject as singular as they would be dealing with one at a time.
   1. `index` and `create` has plural helpers as they are `collection` routes.
   2. There are only 2 variatioons.
      1. `subjects_path` plural
      2. `subject_path(:id)` singular
         1. For other cases, just put new, edit, delete in start of it.
   
| HTTP Verb | URL                  | Action  | URL Helper               |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| GET       | /subjects            | index   | subjects_path            |
| GET       | /subjects/:id        | show    | subject_path(:id)        |
| GET       | /subjects/new        | new     | new_subject_path         |
| POST      | /subjects            | create  | subjects_path            |
| GET       | /subjects/:id/edit   | edit    | edit_subject_path(:id)   |
| PATCH     | /subjects/:id        | update  | subject_path(id)         |
| GET       | /subjects/:id/delete | delete  | delete_subject_path(:id) |
| DELETE    | /subjects/:id        | destroy | subject_path(id)         |

3. URL helpers help to genrate correct URL.
```
<%= link_to('All Subjects', subjects_path) %>

<%= link_to('All Subjects', subjects_path(: page => 3) %>

<%= link_to('Show Subject', subject_path(@subject.id)) %>

<%= link_to('Show Subject', subject_path(@subject.id, : format => 'verbose')) %>

<%= link_to('Edit Subject', edit_subject_path(@subject.id)) %>
```
