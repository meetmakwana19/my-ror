### V48 - REST (Representational State Transfer)

1. Do not perform procedures 
2. Perform state trasformations upon resources.

REST Paradigm Requirements

1. Organize code into resources

   Encourages one controller for each model

2. Learn HTTP verbs(GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) for working with resources

   Determine which CRUD actions are suited for each verb

3. Map a new URL syntax to controller actions

   Change Rails routes

4. Modify existing links and forms to use new URL syntax.    

   Use resourceful URL helpers

- Different HTML versions have varying number of support for REST. So rails have a work around for it to work REST universally.
  - It fakes a true REST request by adding a hidden field called `_method` to the form and uses POST for that form.
