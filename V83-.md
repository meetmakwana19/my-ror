## V83 - Cookies 

1. They allow us to preserve "state" of the web app.
2. Web server sends data to the browser which then saves it in a cookie
3. Browser sends cookie data with each future request to the web server

- Cookies in rails work just like a hash of the values.
- Assigning value to a cookie 
  ```
  cookies[:username] = "meetmak" 

  cookies[:username] = {
    :value => "meetmak",
    :expires => 1.week.from_now 
  ```

- Limitations :
  - Max data size : 4Kb (~4000 chars) and the rest chars will be ignored.
  - Resides on user's computer
  - User can delete, read or alter the cookies. So cookies cant be always trusted by the web server as it can be altered by the user.

- Advice on usage :
  - Use to preserve state and save time.
  - Store only small pieces of data
  - Don't store model instances
  - Don't store sensitive data. sss
