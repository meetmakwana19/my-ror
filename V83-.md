## V83 - Cookies 

1. They allow us to preserve "state" of the web app.
2. Web server sends data to the browser which then saves it in a cookie
3. Browser sends cookie data with each future request to the web server

- Cookies in rails work just like a hash of the values.
- Assigning value to a cookie 
  ```
  cookies[:username] = "meetmak" 

  cookies[:username] = {
    :value => "meetmak",
    :expires => 1.week.from_now 
  ```

- Limitations :
  - Max data size : 4Kb (~4000 chars) and the rest chars will be ignored.
  - Resides on user's computer
  - User can delete, read or alter the cookies. So cookies cant be always trusted by the web server as it can be altered by the user.

- Advice on usage :
  - Use to preserve state and save time.
  - Store only small pieces of data
  - Don't store model instances
  - Don't store sensitive data. 

---
## V84 - Sessions 

1. Designed to address the problem of preserving state of the web app
2. eb server sends a session ID  to the browser, which then the browser saves the session ID in a cookie of the browser.
3. Browser sends session ID with each future request to the web server.
4. Then the web server uses this session ID to locate the session file.
5. The session file has the data we want to store/process.
6. Session ID is not browser side but a server side entity which cannot be altered by the users.

- Using sessions is similar to cookies like using hash of the values 
  ```
  session[:username] = "meetmak"
  ```

- Limitations :
  - Requires timme to retireve the file using the session identifier. On a busy high traffic server the retrieval time will be noticable.
  - Session files accumulate on the server over time and it is upto the programmer tjo delete the old ones.
  - Session cookie resides on user's computer so it can be delted/hijacked. Like if the session ID gets in the hands od hacker then hacker can present itself like the actual user.

- Session Storage 
  1. File storage 
  2. Databse storage
  3. Cookie storage ( since rails 3 and default since then)

- Rails cookie storage
  1. "Super cookies"
  2. Fast and no lookup needed
  3. No setup required
  4. No file/DB bloat
  5. These super cookies are sent to the user's browser.
  6. Encrypted to prevent reading
  7. Cryptographically Signed to prevent tampering.
  8. Max size of 4Kb
  
- If dont want to use cookie storage then configure it

## V85 - Controller filters (Controller callbacks)


1. Allow us to execute the code before/after a controller action.
2. Filter request before allowing actions
3. Remove code repetition
4. Perfor "housekeeping" tasks.(Setup/cleanup)

Uses : 

1. Confirm user authentication 
2. Set variables & default values needed by the templates.
3. Find database objects
4. Get shopping cart 
   
Methods :

1. before_action
2. after_action
3. around_action

- Any render/redirect methods inside the action method will prevent it's execution.
- Specify which actions activaye the filter with :
  ```
  :only => [:method1, :method3]
  :except => [:method2]
  ```
- Any filters defined in the `ApplicationController` are iherited by all the controllers.
- * All of the controllers are inherited from the `ApplicationController` class.
- Inherited filters can be skipped.
  1. skip_beore_action
  2. skip_after_action
  3. skip_around_action 

 1. Added before_action in the pages_controller.rb  

---

## V86 - Logging (Application logs)

- Log files used by rails 
- Log level configuration will be in the `config/environmen/` filees 
  - default is the `:debug` level for development.rb
  - ![Log levels table](image.png)
- 5 log levels 
  1. `:debug` shows everything 
     1. errors
     2. deprecations
     3. render details about the templates 
     4. request details about the parameters that were sent 
     5. SQL which is composed.
  2. `:info` 
     1. Leaves the SQL part as it maybe a privacy concern 
  3. `:warn` 
     1. Only shows deprecations and errors ie. when things go wrong
  4. `:error` - shows recoverable errors
  5. `:fatal` - shows show stopping errors from recovering if not possible
  
- Can clear log files from the terminal using `rails log:clear` 
- Or can set up log rotations which automatically archives and clears the logs.
- Can write to the log files via the controller
```
logger.debug("The name is #(@subject.name}")

logger.info("Starting the subject update...") 

logger.warn("Invalid log in by #(params[:username]}") 

logger.error("Page #(params[:id]) not found") 

logger.fatal ("Necessary RubyGem not loaded")
```

Implementation :

1. Clear the log file by using the command `rails log:clear`.
2. Upon running the server, after doing some actions on the web app, corresponding logs are generated in that log file.
3. Changes config.log_level to `:warn` from `:debug`.
4. Tried adding a `loggr` to the subjectsController index def and the log was reflected succesfully in the console and log file.

##  V87 - Authentication 

1. Admin creates a user and password is encrypted by rails 
2. At login page, search for username in the DB and compare the password after encrypting with the encrypted password. 
3. Mark the user as authenticated 
   1. Set session variable as the user ID.
   2. Redirect user to post-logiin page 
4. User requests additional passwrod-protected pages, session data available will be used with each request. `before_action` control filter will be used for this check.
5. Logout - will set the userId stored inside the session variable to be NULL.

---
### V88 - Secure passwords 

1. Rails uses Blowfish encryption algorithm.
2. `has_secure_password` method of rails that we can put into any ActiveRecord model.
   1. Prequestes are the following before using this method :
      1. `bcyrpt`(blowfish) gem installed
      2. Tables must have a string column name "password_digest".

Implementation :

1. Uncommenting the line of bcrypt gem in the gemfile 
2. Creating a new migration for adding a new column of password_digest 
```
rails generate migration AddPasswordDigestToAdmin
```
3. Added up and down methods in that migration file and ran `rails db:migrate`.
4. Now a new column in the admin_users table has been added in the schema.rb
5. Just added one line `has_secure_password` in the admin_user.rb model.

### `has_secure_password`

Adds `attr_reader :password` for password that assigns a value to the password. ANd this password will be autommatically encrypted by the blowfish and set this hash equal to password_digest but not yet save it.
```
attr_reader :password

#so that no user can create an user without passsword
validates_presence_of :password, :create 
validates_confirmation_of :password

def authenticate(unencrypted_password)
  #... returns True/False on checking the DB password_digest matching
end
```

1. Start rails console 
2. ```
    user = AdminUser.first
    ```
3. Add a password for that user 
```
user.password = 'testpassword'
```
4. Then check the digest which will give the hash form.
```
irb(main):005:0> user.password_digest 
=> "$2a$12$vEXj5IzVitWCKvGqQschROcQiyhw/BUHSAz9wSbxwsp0929R93r9u"
```
5. Save the user 
```
user.save
```
6. Start the mysql console and check the column 
```
 mysql -u rails_user -p simple_cms_development
```
7. Authenticating and testing
```
irb(main):007:0> u = AdminUser.first
irb(main):008:0> u.authenticate("yooohahaha")
=> false
irb(main):009:0> u.authenticate("testpassword")
=> #<AdminUser id: 1, first_name: "Meet", last_name: "Makwana", username: "meeti678", email: "meet@meet.com", created_at: "2022-10-05 15:49:13", updated_at: "2022-10-08 11:22:00", password_digest: "$2a$12$vEXj5IzVitWCKvGqQschROcQiyhw/BUHSAz9wSbxwsp..."
```

---
## V89 - Create a contoller for access(login/logout) and login form 

1. Generate a controller with 2 templates `menu` and `login`.
```
rails generate controller Acess menu login 
```
2. Added routes in the routes.rb
3. Can use resourcefull routes naming by getting the prefixes of the routes by the command `rails routes` on the command line.
4. Populated the templates for menu and login.
5. Added layout keyword in the access_controller.rb
6. Tried the web app !
7. NOw skeleton for user authentication is ready consisting of 
   1. Routes needed
   2. controller
   3. view templates 

---
## V90 - Logout Login controller actions

1. Writing code in the attempt_login and logout definitions in the access_controller.rb
2. Remember,  using `flash[:notice]` will show the notice on the next upcoming page thats y we use `redirect_to` with it. But rendering a page in the same request wont display the notice so dont use `render` with flash but use redirect_to.
   1. Solution : Can se `flash.now` along with `render` to show the notice in the ame request
3. Updated a password for an user using rails console
```
u = AdminUser.first

u.password = "secretpassword"

u.save
```
4. Then tried http://localhost:3000/admin and http://localhost:3000/access/login 
5. **PLEASE AVOOID TYPOS OF _ACCESS_**

---
## V91 - Restrict access

1. Adding `before_action` in the access_controller.

• Add before_action to each controller
   - Be careful not to forget any controller

• Move before_action to ActionController
   - Must use `skip_before_action` in public controllers if making public controllers for public access

• Create AdminAreaController
   - Inherit from ActionController, change all the AdminAreaControllers to inherit from it, add before_action

2. Adding `confirm_logged_in` def in the ApplicationController.
3. Adding `before_action :confirm_logged_in` to all the other controllers(Subjects, pages, sections)
4. All working fine :)

---
## V92 - Challenge AdminUser CRUD

- In Model, 
  1. Define a method #name that returns first_name and last_name with a space between
  2. Define a named scope called #sorted that orders by last_name and then first_name

- In controller,
  1. Generate AdminUsers Controller
  2. index, new, create, edit, update, delete, destroy (No show action)
  3. Replace the match routes with resourceful routes
  4. Use 'admin' layout
  5. index: sort by last_name, then first_name
  6. Write all other actions yourself
  7. Use strong parameters to permit mass-assignment
  8. Restrict access to all actions to logged-in users

- In Views
  1. Set the HTML page title in each template
  2. Use view and form helpers
  3. Display form errors
  4. Link from access/menu.html.erb to admin user CRUD 
  5. Link from admin_users/index.html.erb back to menu

---
## V93 - Solution to challenge 

1. Added a `name` def and scope variable `sorted` in the admin_user.rb model
2. ON command line 
```
rails generate controller AdminUsers index new edit delete
```
3. Replaced the match rouutes with the resourcefull route in routes.rb
4. Wrote code in admin_user_controller.
5. Populates all the view template files of admin_users and created a `_form.html.erb`.
6. Added `admin_users_path` in the menu.html.erb.

---
## V94 - Public area

1. Created a new controller for public section.
```
ails generate controller Public index show
```
2. Changing root route from demo to public#index
3. Populated methods in the public_controller
4. Populated show and index view templates of public.
5. Added back to link and @page_title in index pages of subjects, pages, sections
6. Added a missing association of `has_many :sections` in the page model coz error was coming for show view template.
7. So the public URLs of http://localhost:3000/show/second and http://localhost:3000/show/first are working 

---
### Next commit :

1. Adding a div for heading and p tag of each tempatebwhich shows the default path. converting h1 tags to h3.
2. Added custom css to primary.css.scss

---
### V95 - Navigation for Public area pages

1. Putting `before_action` in th publicController.
2. CReating a partial for navigation in the layouts directory.
3. `link_to_unless_current` - link to if the page is not current page, and is the page is current page then display the page.name as just text.
4. There's no resourcefull route / prefix default for the show action as  ther's no conntroller for it.
```
Prefix        Verb   URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
root          GET    /                              public#index
              GET    /show/:permalink(.:format)     public#show
access_menu   GET    /access/menu(.:format)         access#menu
```
5. That's ok, we can add of our own in the routes.rb by using keyword `:as => 'public_show' ` in the route definition.
6. Now the prefix will be available !
```
Prefix        Verb   URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
root          GET    /                              public#index
public_show   GET    /show/:permalink(.:format)     public#show
access_menu   GET    /access/menu(.:format)         access#menu
```

7. Created a new partial `_navigation` in the layouts/ directory.
8. REndered the navigation partial in  the public layout.

---

### V96 - Nesting pages in subjects

1. ALl components like pages, subjects, sections have their own controller.
2. In the index view of subjects 
   1. Link pagesController to the index action
   2. Send subject_id in link params as in the pages_controller we need to be aware which subject we are dealing with.
3. In the pages_controller
   1. before_Action to find subject
   2. #index scopes @pages by subject to get a list of only pages of that subject.
   3. #new action uses subject to pre-select the subject for a new page
   4. Always preserve the :subject_id on redirects.
4. In the pages template :
   1. All the links and form actions will need preserve :subject_id

Implementation :

1. Added a action link in the index of subject template
2. Tweaked css for action in 
3. Added before _action in pages_controller.
4. Mainting the subject in all the redirects in pages_controller, show template of subjects.

---
### V97 - Nesting sections in pages 

1. ADDING ANOTHER LINK FOR VIEW sections by passing just the page_id for that section in the index page of pages.
2. Added a new before_action `find_page` in the sectionsController.
   1. Changed the `@section` variable by using the `@pages.sections` syntax in all the methods in the sectionsController
   2. Sending page id in the def new and create.
   3. So that the every section generated by this controller will have it's page_id
3. Added `:page_id => @page.id ` to the section_path in the sections show view template for link_to and 
   1. url to the sectionsnew template along with link_to's updating with page.id
   2. link_to and url for form_for in the sections edit template
   3. Same for delete template.
4. Added `:page_id => @page.id ` in all the link_to too in the sections index view template.
   1. Added a link back to the list of pages.
5. Corrected a typo of pages_path to page_path in the pages edit template.
6. Removing the ability to change pages and subjects upon editing by removing the select field and showing just text in the _form templates of sections and pages.
   1. But this will cause an error on creating new pages as in pagescontroller, so in def create added a line `@page.subject = @subject`.
   2. Removed `:subject_id` from the whitelisting of page_params as it is not which we will select.
   3. Same for sectionsController.
7. Commenting out the before_Action method of find_subjects as dont need it to display the select options as not giving that edit allowance.
8. Fixed typo of :subject_path in the pages new template.

---
## V98 - Adding RubyGems : `acts_As_list`

1. Added `set_section_count` before_Action in the sectionsController.
2. Edited the `set_page_coount` before_action in the pages_controller.
3. A major problem for subjects, when 2 subjects having same position then they stay close to each other but what about shifting all other subjects ? 
4. Use ruby gems to solve problems already existing out there. 
5. Using gem `acts_as_list` for this problem
6. Adding the gem in gemfile by adding this line 
```
gem 'acts_as_list'
```
7. ran `bundle install` on the command line.
8. Sort the content in proper manner first before usung the gem.
9. NOw upon editing, the automatic rotation around the position will work.
