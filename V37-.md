#### V37 - Query methods : Conditions 

1. 
```
Subject.where(conditions)
```

    1. These conditions can be expressed in 
       1. Strings ( `"name="test" AND visbile=true"` )
       2. Arrays
       3. Hash forms
2. String conditions :
   1. FLexible due to it's form of raw SQL.
   2. Use carefull coz of SQL Injection attack when the value is passed dynamically like `"name='#{@name}'"` where @name can be --hacker code--.
   3. So use static strings as conditions
3. Array conditions :
   1. Can be used for dynamic values
   2. Safe from SQL Injecton/
   3. eg. `["name=? AND visible=true", "test"]
4. Hash conditions 
   1. `{:name =. "Test", :visible => true}`
   2. Each key-value pair is joint automatically with AND.
   3. Safe from SQL Injection.
5. Conditions return an ActiveRelation and are chained.
6. Executing HAsh condition
```
subjects = Subject.where(:visible => true)
subjects = Subject.where(:visible => true, :position => 1)
```
chainable condition in hash
```
subjects = Subject.where(:visible => true).where(:position => 1)
```
```
irb(main):003:0> subjects.class
=> Subject::ActiveRecord_Relation
irb(main):004:0> subjects.to_sql
=> "SELECT `subjects`.* FROM `subjects` WHERE `subjects`.`visible` = TRUE"
```
7. String conditions
```
subjects = Subject.where("visible = true")
```
8. Array condition
```
subjects = Subject.where(["visible = ?", "false"])
```
