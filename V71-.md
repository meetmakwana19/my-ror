### V71 - Asset pipleline for Javascript 

Steps :

1. Write JavaScript file
   1. Location :
      1. With asset pipeline: /app/assets/javascripts
      2. Without asset pipeline: /public/javascripts
   2. File name - End in ".js"; CoffeeScript files end in ".coffee"
   3. What is CoffeeScript?
      1. Scripting language that is compiled into JavaScript
      2. Different syntax
      3. More concise, readable code
      4. Not part of rails framework but it's included in the rails app. Requires coffee-rails and uglifier gems
      5. Still controversial as some people love it while some hate it.
   4. jQuery
      1. Popular JavaScript framework
      2. Included by default
      3. jquery-rails gem
      4. Listed in manifest file
2. List JavaScript file in manifest
3. Add manifest to asset precompile list
4. Include a JavaScript tag in HTML

Implementation :

**Writing JS file**
1. Deleting example, pages, sections and subjects coffee script files.

**Manifesting files**
1. Renaming `demo.coffee` to `demo.js` and backspacing all the content inside it and adding a custom simple JS.
2. `cable.js` - Is a manifest file and used for Getting features together for the action cable. Action cable is a higher level piece of technology not needed by a begineer,
3. `application.js` is the main manifest file mentioning which files to manifest in what order.
   1. In the last `turbolinks` is mentioned which is an advanced tech not needed by us so can leave it/remove it. Disabling it
   2. `require_tree .` line at the end tells to add all the files in the current directory of `/app/assets/javascripts/`. Although dont need it so will backspacing `=` sylmbol before it.
   3. Will add demo to the manifest file.
**Listing for pre-compilation**
1. In `/config/initializers/asset.rb`, no need to do anything as application.js is already included for compilation.

**Adding JS link to HTML page**

1. Use rails stylesheet helper instead of html link tag
```
<%= javascript_include_tag ('application') %>
```
2. demo_controller had `layout false`, make it `layout 'application'`
3. Add a javascript link in the `/app/views/demo/index.html.erb` and check the url http://localhost:3000/demo/index
4. Upon page inspection, multiple files are being loaded and in production all of these files will be compressed one single file.
