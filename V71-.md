### V71 - Asset pipleline for Javascript 

Steps :

1. Write JavaScript file
   1. Location :
      1. With asset pipeline: /app/assets/javascripts
      2. Without asset pipeline: /public/javascripts
   2. File name - End in ".js"; CoffeeScript files end in ".coffee"
   3. What is CoffeeScript?
      1. Scripting language that is compiled into JavaScript
      2. Different syntax
      3. More concise, readable code
      4. Not part of rails framework but it's included in the rails app. Requires coffee-rails and uglifier gems
      5. Still controversial as some people love it while some hate it.
   4. jQuery
      1. Popular JavaScript framework
      2. Included by default
      3. jquery-rails gem
      4. Listed in manifest file
2. List JavaScript file in manifest
3. Add manifest to asset precompile list
4. Include a JavaScript tag in HTML

Implementation :

**Writing JS file**
1. Deleting example, pages, sections and subjects coffee script files.

**Manifesting files**
1. Renaming `demo.coffee` to `demo.js` and backspacing all the content inside it and adding a custom simple JS.
2. `cable.js` - Is a manifest file and used for Getting features together for the action cable. Action cable is a higher level piece of technology not needed by a begineer,
3. `application.js` is the main manifest file mentioning which files to manifest in what order.
   1. In the last `turbolinks` is mentioned which is an advanced tech not needed by us so can leave it/remove it. Disabling it
   2. `require_tree .` line at the end tells to add all the files in the current directory of `/app/assets/javascripts/`. Although dont need it so will backspacing `=` sylmbol before it.
   3. Will add demo to the manifest file.
**Listing for pre-compilation**
1. In `/config/initializers/asset.rb`, no need to do anything as application.js is already included for compilation.

**Adding JS link to HTML page**

1. Use rails stylesheet helper instead of html link tag
```
<%= javascript_include_tag ('application') %>
```
2. demo_controller had `layout false`, make it `layout 'application'`
3. Add a javascript link in the `/app/views/demo/index.html.erb` and check the url http://localhost:3000/demo/index
4. Upon page inspection, multiple files are being loaded and in production all of these files will be compressed one single file.

### V72 - Another way of adding JS content to templates and SANTIZING

1. JavaScript Helpers - MOstly put them in the end of the HTML file.
```
<%= javascript_tag("alert('Are you sure?');") %>

<%= javascript_tag do %> alert('Are you sure?'); <% end %>

```
O/P rendered :

```
<script>
//<![CDATA[
alert('Are you sure?');
//]]>
</script>
```

2. Sanitizing JavaScript

```
MALICIOUS INPUT STRING by hacker :
<% text = "'); alert('Gotcha!" %>
```
```
<%= javascript_tag("alert('You said: #{text}');") %> 
```

```
result in 2 malicious alerts :
alert('You said: '); alert('Gotcha!');
```

To prevent this malicious attempt 
--> Use escape_javascript(), j()

```
<%= javascript_tag("alert('You said: #{j(text)}');") %> 
```

2 different alerts were the input string is escaped using backward slash `\`.
```
alert('You said: \'); alert(\'Gotcha!');
```
3. Put escaping only around user submitted portion.

---
### V73 - Asset pipeline for adding images

1. Location With asset pipeline: /app/assets/images 
2. Without asset pipeline: /public/images
3. User-uploaded images must be in : /public/images 
4. Image upload gems for user uploading images 
   `Paperclip and CarrierWave`
5. Rails Image Helpers
   ```
   <%= image_tag('logo.png') %>
   <%= image_tag ('logo.png', :size => '90x55', :alt => 'logo') %>
   <%= image_tag('logo.png', :width => 90, height => 55) %>
   ```
Remember to add single quotes and not double.
Implementation :

1. Add images for plus sign and footer gradient in the `/app/assets/images` 
2. Adding image link tag in the subjects index view
3. Upon page inspection, it is evident that the immage is loaded from the asset directory along with a hash following in it's name. 
4. Added `image-url("footer_gradient.png")` helper in the primary styleseet.
5. Customized footer main div css in primary styleseet.
6. Corrected typo in  layouts `admin.html.erb`

---
### V74 - Rails form helpers

1. Form Helper Types
text style - Will create simplest andd most flexible form of HTML input tag
```
<%= text_field_tag ('name', params[:name]) %>
```

Object aware style - Prepopulates the field with the attributes value
```
<%= text_field(:subject, name) %>
```

form builder style - JUst a shorthand form of the above helper as f will be used to refer the :subject
```
<%= f.text_field(:name) %>
```

Other form helpers
• radio_button

• password field

• check_box

• text_area

• file field

• hidden field

• label


**Example :**

```
form_for(@subject, :html => {:multipart => true}) do 1f||
   f.label(: name) 
   
   f.text_field ( : name, :size => 40, :maxlength => 40) 
   
   f.password_field (: password, :size => 40) 
   
   <!-- hidden from user -->
   f.hidden_field(:token, "abcdef0123456789')
   
   f.text_area(:description, :size => "40x5") # :cols/: rows
   
   f.radio_button(:content_type, "text") 
   f.radio_button(:content_type, "HTML")
   
   <!-- html check box which is unckecked wont send any true/false in the parameters but rails helper send bydefault 0 value if the checkbox isn't checked -->
   f.check_box (:visible)
   
   <!-- allows to pick a file from the hard-drive to upload. -->
   f.file field(:logo) # requires :multipart => true sometimes which is declared above in the definition as form_for takes care of it.
end
```

Implementation :

1. Adding check_box helper in the form templates of subjects, pages, sections.
2. Added `radio_button` and `text_area` in the form of sections.
3. Corrected margin css for form_buttons in admin_additions.css.scss

---
### V75 - Form helpers to work with select option tags

1. Select helper
   1. Object we're working with
   2. Attributes of that object
   3. Choices user is going to select between
   4. Hash of options
   5. Hash of html_options.
   ```
   select(object, attribute, choices, options, html_options)
   ```
   options:

      :selected => object.attribute

      :include_blank => false 

      :prompt => false 

      :disabled => false


2. `choices` argument - full list of options/option tags the user can choose from. Several ways to tell the controller to create these choices

```
form_for(@section) do |f||

   # Range to select from 1 to 5
   f.select( : position, 1..5 )

   # Array of choices
   f.select( :content_type, ['text', 'HTML'] ).

   # Hash - User sees the label Visible, Hidden and 1,2 gets sent to the database.
   f.select( :visible, { "Visible" => 1, "Hidden" => 2 })
   
   # Array of arrays 
   f.select( :page_id, Page.all.map {[p] [ p.name, p.id ]} )

end

```

3. Adding select range helper in the subjects form for position.
   1. For subject_count, adding an instance varibale in the subjects_controller def new and edit
4. Did same for pages and sections.
5. Adding subject id for page id using arrays of array select helper.

---
### V76 - Date and Time form helpers

3 Main helpers :

1. `date_select` - WIll generate 3 diff options (D, M, Y)
   ```
   date_select(object, attribute, options, html_options)

      Options:

      :start year => Time.now.year-5 
      
      :end_year => Time. now.year+5 
      
      :order => [:year, month, :day] :
      
      discard year => false 
      
      :discard_month => false 
      
      :discard_day => false 
      
      :include_blank => false 
      
      :prompt => false 
      
      :use_month_numbers => false 
      
      :add_month_numbers => false 
      
      :use_short_month => false 
      
      :date_separator => ""
   ```

2. `time_select` helper
   ```
   time_select(object, attribute, options, html_options)

      Options:

      :include_seconds => false 
      
      :minute_step => 1 
      
      :include_blank => false 
      
      :prompt => false 
      
      :time_separator => ":"

   ```

3. `datetime_select` helper
   ```
   datetime_select(object, attribute, options, html_options)

      Options:
      
      # all date_select and time_select options 
      :datetime separator => "-".


   ```

1. Adding datetime in forms templates.
   1. Added `datetime_select` form helper
   2. WHitelisted `created_at` in the def subject_params of subjects_controller

---
### V77 - Form errors 

- Reasons cant an object be saved to the DB.

1] **Simple validation** 

eg. `validates_presence_of :name` will  require some vakue in name field.

2] Rails will add the errors to **object.errors** which is an array like structure for holding any validation errors.
Will reload the form from the controller to give user the chance to fix the error.
object.errors can be used to display errors.

- Useful Methods for Errors
```
object.errors.clear 

object.errors.size 

object.errors.each {|attr, msg| ... }
# :name, "can't be blank" 

object.errors.full_messages.each { msg| ... }
# "Name can't be blank"
```

- Two ways to display errors :
  - List errors above the form
  - Print and highlight errors with each input.

1. List errors above the form
   1. Create an HTML Partial containing everything we need to display our error msgs. `app/views/application/_error_messages.html.erb`
   2. Write custom helper to call it whenever we need an error to be displayed. `error_messages_for(:object)`.

Implementation of 1st way :
1. Create new dir `application` in views to store the the partial `_error_messages.html.erb` in it.
2. Wrote `error_messages_for` method in the application_helper.
3. Putting `error_messages_for(f.object)` at the top og the form templates of all 3 subjects, sections, pages.
4. Added validation of name in the subject model.

### V78 - Prevent Cross-site request forgery 

• "CSRF" for short

• Type of attack on a website

• Exploits user's currently logged-in state to perform
actions which require authentication
```
<img src = "http://bank.com?amt=1500000">
```
Eg. leaving bank's website logged in and then going to other site which may be malicious and upin clicking any wrong element over there might send a request to bank's server. This is called cross site request forgery.

_Prevent CSRF :_

• Require user authentication

• Regularly log out inactive users

• GET requests should be read-only

• Actions that expect POST requests should only respond to POST requests.

1. Rails gives **Autheenticity Token** and generates it and puts in the hidden field of every form.
   1. The token is stored in the session file to  compare the tokens when rails recieve the form and it gets authenticated.
   2. All this is done automatically by the rails.
   3. `ApplicationController` inherits it from an imp `ActionController`.
      1. Added this line as it wasn't there.
      ```
      protect_from_forgery with: :exception
      ```
2. If working with  Javascipt/Ajax requests then need to put `<%= csrf_meta_tag %>` in the `<head>` o the html doc which will add some JS so that the JS requests can have same access to Autheenticity tokens and forgery protection like regular HTML post requests do.

---
### V79 - Validation methods

• Ensure data meets requirements before saving to database

• Cant put th validation code in the  controller as everytime controller will come into action so need to make it global in the application.

• Validation code resides in models as this concerns are with the interaction of the app with the DB.

• We use `ActiveRecord::Validations` to define our rules in the model. 

• Failed validations: will not save, model will track errors too.

• 10 Validation methods provided by the ActiveRecord

```
validates_presence_of 
validates_length_of 
validates_numericality_of 
validates_inclusion_of 
validates_exclusion of
validates_format_of
validates_uniqueness_of
validates_acceptance_of 
validates_confirmation_of 
validates_associated
```

1. Used `validates_presence_of ` in the subjects model in the previous video no. 77.
   1. Ensure that the attribute is not blank (nil, false, "", " ", [], {})
2. `validates_length_of` must meet length requirements 
   1. `:is, :minimum, :maximum, :within, :in`
   2. `:wrong_length => "is the wrong length (should be {{count}} characters)" `
   3. `:too_short => "is too short (minimum is {{count}} characters)" `
   4. `:too_long => "is too long (maximum is {{count}} characters)"`
3. `validates_numericality_of` - Attribute must be integer or floating point number.
   1. :equal_to
   2. :greater_than 
   3. :less_than
   4. :greater_than_or_equal_to 
   5. :less_than_or_equal_to,
   6. :odd, :even, 
   7. :only_integer 
   8. :message => "is not a number"
4. `validates_inclusion_of` - Attr must be in the list of choices(array/range). Use `:in`.
5. `validates_exclusion_of` - Attr must not be in the list of choices(array/range). Use `:in`.
6. `validates_format_of` - Attr must match a reguar expression. 
   1. Use `:with`.
   2. Good for email checking.
7. `validates_uniqueness_of` - Attr must not exist in the DB. Followng options are used :
   1. `:case_sensitive`
   2. `:scope`
8. `validates_acceptance_of` - Attr must be accepted.
   1. Use for checkboxes of TnC.
   2. Creates a virtual attribute if no table column.
   3. Option uses is `:accept (expected value, "1")`
9. `validates_confirmation_of` 
   1.  Must be entered twice, For eg. password
   2.  Creates a virtual attribute for the confirmation.
   3.  ONly validates when confirmation attribute is not nill.
   4. `validates_associated` - Validates ActiveRecoord aassociations like has_many, belongs_to.
      1. Associated object/s must be validated.
      2. First attribute will be the 'asssociation name' and not attribute.
      3. Calls #valid? on the object/array of objects.
      4. Does not fail if object does not exist so need to use presence_of.
      5. Beware of infinite loops and long casscades

> Global Options: Most Methods

• `:allow_nil => true` - Skips validation if attribute is nil (no value set)
• `:allow_blank => true` - Skips validation if attribute is blank
• `:on => :save / :create / :update` - It only validates if this is a new record (:create) or an eisting record (:update). `:save` validates in both casses and is the default.
• `:if => :method / :unless => :method` - If the method in the model return True/False.

---
### V80 - Write validations.

</br>

### What to Validate?
1. What are your data concerns?
   1. Decide what good and bad data looks like.
2. What restrictions does your database impose? 
   1. Field types, field lengths, and null allowed
3. What would stop your application from working?
4. A good way to start is to review attribures of each model.
5. Validations are not required on IDs, foreign keys, timestamps, booleans. They're so simple that they dont require validations and they're managed by the framework.

### Implementaion :

1. Adding validations in the subject, page, section, admin_user models.
2. Starting `rails c` on terminal 
3. `s = Subject.new`
4. yo
   ```
   > s.errors.count
   => 0
   ```
5. Running validations
   ```
   > s.valid?
   => false
   ```
   Not a valid form
6. Checking it 
   ```
   s.errors
   => #<ActiveModel::Errors:0x00005623c0e83ae8 @base=#<Subject id: nil, name: nil, position: nil, visible: false, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>, @messages={:name=>["can't be blank"]}, @details={:name=>[{:error=>:blank}]}>
   ```
   There's error in name field and it is blank.
7. checking the msg
   ```
   irb(main):017:0> s.errors.count
   => 1
   irb(main):018:0> s.errors.full_messages
   => ["Name can't be blank"]
   ```
8. Tried overcoming that error by adding a name
   ```
   irb(main):019:0> s.name = "test"
   irb(main):020:0> s.errors.count
   => 1
   irb(main):021:0> s.valid?
   => true
   irb(main):022:0> s.errors.count
   => 0
   irb(main):023:0> s.errors.full_messages
   => []
   ```
9. Tried another validation 
   ```
   irb(main):024:0> s.name = "x" * 300
   irb(main):025:0> s.name
   => "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   irb(main):026:0> s.valid?
   => false
   irb(main):027:0> s.errors.full_messages
   => ["Name is too long (maximum is 255 characters)"]
   ```
10. Adding a user 
   ```
   us = AdminUser.new(:first_name => 'Meet', :last_name => 'Makwana', :username => 'meeti')
   ```
   Waas getting error in adding this so edited the name `username` in create_Admin migration file and dropped and created the admin_user table again using migration methods up and down.
11. Checking validation 
   ```
   irb(main):015:0> us.errors.full_messages
   => ["Username is too short (minimum is 8 characters)"]
   ```
12. Checking validation 
   ```
   irb(main):016:0> us.valid?
  AdminUser Exists (0.7ms)  SELECT  1 AS one FROM `admin_users` WHERE `admin_users`.`username` = BINARY 'meeti' LIMIT 1
   Traceback (most recent call last):
         1: from (irb):16
   NoMethodError (undefined method `email' for #<AdminUser:0x00005605b44f43a8>
   ```
   So fixing that email issue by adding email in create_Admin migration file and dropped and created the admin_user table again using migration methods up and down.
13. yo
   ```
   > u = AdminUser.new(:first_name => 'Meet', :last_name => 'Makwana', :username => 'meeti')

   > u.valid?
   => false

   > u.errors.full_messages
   => ["Username is too short (minimum is 8 characters)", "Email can't be blank", "Email is invalid"]
   ```
14. yo
   ```
   irb(main):005:0> u.username = 'meeti678'
   irb(main):006:0> u.valid?
   AdminUser Exists (0.6ms)  SELECT  1 AS one FROM `admin_users` WHERE `admin_users`.`username` = BINARY 'meeti678' LIMIT 1
   => false
   irb(main):007:0> u.errors.full_messages
   => ["Email can't be blank", "Email is invalid"]

   irb(main):012:0> u.email = 'meet.com'
   irb(main):011:0> u.errors.full_messages
   => ["Email is invalid"]

   irb(main):016:0> u.email = 'meet@meet.com'
   irb(main):014:0> u.valid?
   => true
   irb(main):015:0> u.errors.full_messages
   => []
   ```
15. Checking email confirmation
   ```
   irb(main):016:0> u.email_confirmation = 'meett@meet.com'
   irb(main):017:0> u.valid?
   => false
   irb(main):018:0> u.errors.full_messages
   => ["Email confirmation doesn't match Email"]
   ```
   The presence of email_confirmation kicks in the validation. 

   Corrected the email_confirmation.
16. Saved the user `u.save`
17. yo
   ```
   irb(main):023:0> u2 = AdminUser.new(:first_name => 'Meet'
   irb(main):024:0> u2.valid?
   AdminUser Exists (0.5ms)  SELECT  1 AS one FROM `admin_users` WHERE `admin_users`.`username` = BINARY 'meeti678' LIMIT 1
   => false
   irb(main):025:0> u2.errors.full_messages
   => ["Username has already been taken", "Email can't be blank", "Email is invalid"]
   ```
   Username already exists !

### Validates Method - Shortcut sexy validation method

1. Instead of 5 diff validations
```
    validates_presence_of :email 

    validates_length_of :email, :maximum => 100

    validates_uniqueness_of :email

    validates_format_of :email, :with => EMAIL_REGEX

    validates_confirmation_of :email
```
2. validation method can be clubbed like this
```
validates :email, :presence => true, :length => { :maximmum => 50 }, :uniqueness => { :with -> EMAIL_REGEX }, :confirmation => true 
```
3. yo
```
validates attribute, :presence => boolean,
                     :numericality => boolean, 
                     :length => options_hash, 
                     :format => {:with => regex}, 
                     :inclusion => {:in => array_or_range}, 
                     :exclusion => {:in => array_or_range}, 
                     :acceptance => boolean, 
                     :uniqueness => boolean, 
                     :confirmation => boolean
```
4. Updated the lonng validations with these sexy on in the admin)user.rb 
5. Always test the written validations in the console to heck for any typos in the file.
